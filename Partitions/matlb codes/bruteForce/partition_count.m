function count = partition_count ( n, w )

%% PARTITION_COUNT counts the solutions to a partition problem.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    We are given a set of N integers W.
%
%    We seek to partition W into subsets W0 and W1, such that the subsets
%    have equal sums.
%
%    The "discrepancy" is the absolute value of the difference between the
%    two sums, and will be zero if we have solved the problem.
%
%    For a given set of integers, there may be zero, one, or many solutions.
%
%    In the case where the weights are distinct, the count returned by this
%    function may be regarded as twice as big as it should be, since the
%    partition (W0,W1) is counted a second time as (W1,W0).  A more serious
%    overcount can occur if the set W contains duplicate elements - in the
%    extreme case, W might be entirely 1's, in which case there is really
%    only one (interesting) solution, but this function will count many.
